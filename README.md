# Repository compiling the notebooks used for the investigation of my M4R Project at Imperial College London 📚

My investigation focused on the analysis of different unsupervised techniques in order to accurately cluster similar TCR sequences (i.e. sequences with a similar antigen specificity). 🫁🫀

Please note that the notebooks were used as exploratory tools 🔍.

Legend: 
The name of the notebooks start with a number that indicates the order in which these techniques and methods are discussed in the research paper. Note that "A" corresponds to extra/appendix notebooks not directly relevant to the analysis.

The **automate.py** file contains some essential functions that automate the pipeline for model building and results plotting. This simplifies readability and usage of our different modelling techniques.

Here is a link to a web application that shows how perform the different deep learning methods:
